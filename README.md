# Calmecac 🤓💻

`Calmecac` is an educational platform that through the use of `Web 3.0` technology requires the payment of a fee to access the courses we offer.

## Inspiration

We are a `Dapp` that allows `students` to delegate capital for their studies, at the end of their course, they get 100% of their money back, making `education` much more accessible to certain `social groups`.

## What it does

Facilitate access to `education` for `students` from all over Latin America without the need to lose their invested capital.
Encourage the new economies proposed by `Web 3.0` technology Become a `Dapp` work to help.

## Challenges we ran into

According to UNESCO data, in the `last three years 100 million students dropped out of school`, and education is subject to the context of the countries resulting in an educational restlessness. With better educational offerings you have better job prospects, better salaries and therefore a better lifestyle.

With this in mind, we propose a capital delegation program where the student at no time loses his investment and can continue with his studies.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud to have created the real-time connection of the `Dapp`, creating the smart contracts of the platform and the base architecture of the project; `front-end`, `back-end` and the `smart contracts` development using `Hardhat`.
